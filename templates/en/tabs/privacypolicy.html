  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 30, 2015</p>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by Ripple Trade,
    LLC (“<strong>Company</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>”).  This Privacy Policy
    applies to information we collect when you use our websites (<a href="http://www.rippletrade.com">www.rippletrade.com</a> and <a href="http://www.id.ripple.com">www.id.ripple.com</a>)
    and the online services made available via our websites (collectively, “<strong>Ripple Trade</strong>”).  Ripple Trade allows you to interact directly with the decentralized
    Ripple transaction protocol payment network (“<strong>Ripple Protocol</strong>”) to create a
    Ripple Protocol wallet (“<strong>Ripple Wallet</strong>”). For your information, <a href="http://www.id.ripple.com">www.id.ripple.com</a> is an interface 
    through which we collect your personally identifiable information (“PII”) for the purpose of identity verification.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.  If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date
    at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as by
    adding a statement to the homepage of our website or by sending you a notification).
  </p><br/>
  <h4>Collection of Information</h4>
  <p><strong> Information You Provide to Us</strong></p>
  <p>
    The information you provide to us is stored in a hosted data storage service
    (“<strong>Blobvault</strong>”).  The Blobvault has three separate components:
  </p>
  <p>
    (1) a public storage component, which contains the Ripple name you create when setting up a Ripple
    Wallet via Ripple Trade;
  </p>
  <p>
    (2) a restricted storage component, which contains the information you provide about any recipient (such as the
    Ripple name or Ripple public address of the recipient) when you send a balance via Ripple Trade; and
  </p>
  <p>
    (3) an ID storage component, which includes contact and other identifiable information you provide about yourself
    via Ripple Trade, including the email address you provide when first setting up a Ripple Wallet and any
    information you submit for identity verification purposes.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Information We Collect Automatically</strong></p>
  <p>When you use our service, we automatically collect information about you, including:</p>

    time of a transaction and other related information.
  </li><br/>
  <li>
    <strong>Ripple Wallet Information</strong>: When you create a Ripple Wallet via Ripple Trade, Ripple Trade generates a
    public address and private key pair for you.  The public address is automatically added to the Blobvault
    public storage component and the private key is automatically added to the Blobvault restricted storage component.

  <p><strong>Information We Collect From Other Sources</strong></p>
  <p>
    We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information you enter on www.rippletrade.com or www.id.ripple.com.
